# Voices from Mulberry Row: A Digital Exhibit

## Mission Statement
This collaborative digital exhibit seeks to illuminate the lives, labor, and resilience of the enslaved community at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation, with a particular focus on the individuals and industries along Mulberry Row. By centering the stories of the people who built and sustained Monticello, we aim to contribute to a more complete and honest public history of slavery in early America.

## Initial Research Questions
1. Who were the skilled artisans and laborers living and working along Mulberry Row?
2. How did the enslaved community navigate the tensions between forced labor and skilled craftsmanship?
3. What can material culture and documentary fragments tell us about the daily lives, relationships, and resistance of enslaved individuals at Monticello?
4. How did Jefferson's ideals of liberty and his reliance on enslaved labor coexist in the space of Mulberry Row?
5. In what ways can digital storytelling and collaborative scholarship recover and honor these histories?
