# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the "Voices from Mulberry Row" digital exhibit project. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a cohesive and respectful collaborative process.

## Workflow Overview
1. **Propose a Topic**: Open an issue describing the individual, craft, or location you wish to research.
2. **Draft Your Entry**: After approval, create a branch and write your Markdown file in the `exhibit/` directory.
3. **Submit for Review**: Open a pull request linking to your issue.
4. **Peer Review**: Review at least two other submissions and address feedback on your own.
5. **Final Merge**: Once approved, your entry will be merged into the main exhibit.

## Content Standards
- **File Format**: All exhibit entries must be written in Markdown (`.md` extension) and placed in the `exhibit/` directory.
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g., `isaac-granger.md`, `hemings-family.md`).
- **Structure**: Each entry should include:
  - A clear title (as a level‑2 heading `##`)
  - An introductory paragraph establishing significance
  - Sections organized with subheadings (e.g., `### Early Life`, `### Work on Mulberry Row`, `### Legacy`)
  - Citations or references to primary/secondary sources (use footnotes or links)
  - Images (if available) placed in `assets/` and linked with descriptive alt text
- **Tone**: Maintain a scholarly yet accessible tone. Center the experiences of enslaved people while acknowledging the limitations of the historical record.

## Style Guide
- Use formal, respectful language; avoid sensationalism.
- Provide dates (when known) in `YYYY‑MM‑DD` format.
- Spell out numbers one through ten; use numerals for 11 and above.
- Link to reliable external sources (e.g., Monticello’s online databases, scholarly articles) using `[link text](URL)`.

## Image & Media Guidelines
- Place all images, document scans, or other media in the `assets/` folder.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `isaac-granger-nailery-1802.jpg`).
- In your Markdown, include images with `![Alt text describing the image](/assets/filename.jpg)`.
- Ensure you have the right to use any media you upload, or use materials that are clearly in the public domain.

## Review Process
- Every pull request must be reviewed by at least two other contributors before merging.
- Reviewers should focus on historical accuracy, clarity, adherence to formatting, and respectful representation.
- Use inline comments on the PR diff to suggest specific changes.
- Authors are expected to respond to feedback and revise their drafts accordingly.

## Code of Conduct
This project is dedicated to providing a harassment‑free experience for everyone. We expect all participants to engage with empathy and respect, especially when discussing painful and sensitive histories. Discriminatory or demeaning language will not be tolerated.

Thank you for helping to build a meaningful and inclusive digital exhibit.
